  * Do not install gnome-control-center.rules for now; it won't work in Debian

  * debian/rules, debian/shlibs.local: Call dh_makeshlibs for libgnome-
    window-settings1 instead of using shlibs.local. It was likely
    there to workaround dpkg-dev setting ignoring the dependency from
    the Depends line and using that of dpkg-shlibdeps, but it's no
    longer the case. As a side effect, this makes the shlibs
    file be versioned as it should be.
